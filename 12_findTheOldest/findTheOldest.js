/* Pseudo Code Breakdown
 
Store birth date and death date
- collect birth year and death year
 
Subtract birth date from death date
 
Oldest age is determined via value comparison
- must return the name of the oldest person
 
If death date is undefined, then substract birth date from Date() method
